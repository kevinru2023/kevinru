## What?

**Notic3** is a decentralized platform built entirely on-chain to empower content creators. Unlike traditional platforms such as Patreon, Notic3 eliminates intermediaries, enabling creators to receive support directly from their audience with transparent, tamper-proof records.  

The platform is powered by **Sui blockchain**, written in **Move**, and leverages **Walrus**, Sui’s native decentralized data storage solution, to store encrypted content blobs directly on-chain. Every creator interaction, from subscription payments to content access — lives on the blockchain, reflecting a full commitment to decentralization.

## Why?

The inspiration for Notic3 came from a desire to push beyond the partial decentralization seen in most Web3 creator tools. Many existing platforms still rely on centralized components or off-chain storage to avoid complexity. Our goal was to explore what true decentralization would look like, even if it meant facing significant technical hurdles.  

As a team passionate about blockchain’s potential to reshape ownership and digital interaction, we wanted to give creators full control over their revenue and content without the constraints or fees of centralized intermediaries. Notic3 became our way of testing the boundaries of what’s possible when you refuse to compromise the principles of transparency and autonomy.

## How?

Notic3 was built using the **Move programming language** on the **Sui blockchain**, a challenge in itself as the language and SDK were entirely new to our team. Every feature, from subscription payments to data storage, was implemented as a smart contract, ensuring that all logic is handled on-chain.

To enable decentralized storage, we used **Walrus**, Sui’s latest data solution, which allows encrypted file blobs to be stored and retrieved directly from the chain. This ensures that creators truly own their content while maintaining privacy and immutability.

Key technical highlights include:
- **Subscription-based smart contracts** that handle recurring payments and instant fund distribution.  
- **On-chain metadata management** to track ownership and access rights securely.  
- **Full-stack decentralization**, avoiding off-chain shortcuts even for content management and file hosting.  

The result is a creator platform that demonstrates both the power and difficulty of going “all in” on decentralization.
