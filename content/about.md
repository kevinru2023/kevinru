## Bio

I'm Kevin Rubio—a Junior at Oregon State University studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I enjoy trying new things, understanding how things function, and working with others to solve hard problems.

During my time at Oregon State University, I have become an active member of the CS community, participating in multiple organizations including:

- OSU App Development Club
- OSU Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
- OSU Cyber Security Club
- OSU Hackathon Club

I'm also passionate about supporting inclusion of under-represented people of color in tech fields through my involvement with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and ColorStack.

My passion for Computer Science stems from childhood when my dad gave me my first laptop to play Club Penguin. That early experience sparked my interest in computers, eventually leading me to pursue Software Engineering as a career. I've been working hard towards this goal ever since.

While at OSU I have created many unique and interesting projects through my involvement in clubs and Hackathons. I have also participated in many CTFs such as DiceCTF, picoCTF, and PlaidCTF just to name a few. Check out more of what I have done in my projects section of my website!

Other than just CS, I also enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and just being active. I also like to play video games, mainly competitive FPS games like CS:GO, Valorant, and Rainbow Six Siege. 

## What's Next

I'm currently working at Oregon State University's Identity Access Management team as a Student Technician providing support to thousands of users each day. During my spare time I am developing little projects or studying up on new topics such as Data Science, System Design, and other random topics that scratch my brain.

I am currently searching for internships for summer 2026. So, if you have any opportunities available I would love to connect. You can reach me at [kevinru2005@gmail.com](mailto:kevinru2005@gmail.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-rubio-851269236/)
