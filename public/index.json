It combines a custom recommendation system, interactive mapping, and collaborative planning features to create a seamless mobile experience.\nThe app is built with React Native on the frontend, while the backend leverages Flask, ElasticSearch, and Supabase to deliver personalized, data-driven recommendations.\nWhy? #Mosaic started as an attempt to solve a common frustration: planning trips with friends often meant juggling group chats, Google Docs, and random links. We wanted to create something that could feel intelligent, a single app that understands what your group enjoys and curates destination ideas to match those shared interests.\nBy blending vector-based recommendation systems with familiar mobile UX patterns, Mosaic transforms group trip planning into a more social and effortless experience.\nHow? #The backend is powered by ElasticSearch and OpenAI embeddings, which together create a custom recommendation engine. Each user and location is represented as a vector, allowing Mosaic to suggest new places based on semantic similarity to past preferences.\nThe app integrates several APIs:\nGoogle Places API for fetching real-world location details. Google Maps API for trip visualization. Supabase for authentication and data management. OpenAI API for generating and refining vector embeddings. The frontend, built in React Native with TypeScript and styled using Expo and Tailwind, provides a clean, modern mobile interface. The experience is optimized for collaboration — users can easily create shared itineraries, explore personalized location feeds, and view travel routes with just a few taps.\nMosaic is bundled in a single mobile app powered by an AI-enhanced backend, creating a truly end-to-end group travel companion.\nGithub Link #Feel free to check out the project on Github\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/mosaic/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Mosaic"},{"content":"Most of these projects are from clubs or various Hackathons I have done.

Data is updated weekly to minimize requests to college websites.\nWhy? #During my sophomore year of college, the App Club wanted to create a chrome extension that would allow OSU students to get more information out of their course planner. This API was created in order to provide information about what courses have a direct community college equivalent to show in the students course planner.\nHow? #This project utilizes python in order to use libraries such as beautiful soup to gather information from Oregon State University websites that contain a list of courses from various community colleges that have a direct OSU course equivalent. Once this information is gathered I utilized some regex expressions to parse the data (as the data was stored in a pre tag) and output this information in an API. The API service utlizies FastAPI to create an easy to use REST API that contains easy to understand documentation. Finally, in order to make it easy to spin up this API, I put everything into a docker file to allow for easy deployment of the API service.\nGithub Link #Feel free to check out the project on Github\n","date":"1 June 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/course-rest-api/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Course REST API"},{"content":" What? #Greeney is a carbon footprint tracker that helps users measure, understand, and reduce their transportation-related emissions. It calculates CO₂e from activities such as ridesharing, food deliveries, and flights, providing insights and visualizations to encourage more eco-conscious decisions.\nThe application uses Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, while the backend API is powered by Flask and Python.\nWhy? #During a period of growing interest in environmental sustainability, me and my friends wanted to create a project that combines data visualization and practical impact. Greeney was designed to empower individuals to better understand their transportation footprint and make more informed daily decisions to reduce emissions.\nThe goal was to create a sleek, accessible tool that not only educates users about their impact but also motivates them to make small, measurable changes for a greener future.\nHow? #The app estimates a user’s carbon footprint using the formula:\nCarbon Emissions (CO₂e) = Carbon Intensity (g CO₂/kWh) × Energy Consumed (kWh)\nIt leverages Google APIs (Distance Matrix, Geocoding, and Gmail OAuth 2.0) to calculate travel distances and authenticate users. The backend Flask API performs emissions calculations and stores user activity data, while the Next.js frontend visualizes trends in CO₂e, kWh, and miles traveled through interactive charts and metrics.\nThe interface is built with ShadCN UI and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and visually engaging experience. Together, these technologies create a seamless user experience for tracking and managing personal emissions.\nGithub Link #Feel free to check out the project on Github\n","date":"1 April 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/greeney/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Greeney"},{"content":" What? #Notic3 is a decentralized platform built entirely on-chain to empower content creators. Unlike traditional platforms such as Patreon, Notic3 eliminates intermediaries, enabling creators to receive support directly from their audience with transparent, tamper-proof records.\nThe platform is powered by Sui blockchain, written in Move, and leverages Walrus, Sui’s native decentralized data storage solution, to store encrypted content blobs directly on-chain. Every creator interaction, from subscription payments to content access — lives on the blockchain, reflecting a full commitment to decentralization.\nWhy? #The inspiration for Notic3 came from a desire to push beyond the partial decentralization seen in most Web3 creator tools. Many existing platforms still rely on centralized components or off-chain storage to avoid complexity. Our goal was to explore what true decentralization would look like, even if it meant facing significant technical hurdles.\nAs a team passionate about blockchain’s potential to reshape ownership and digital interaction, we wanted to give creators full control over their revenue and content without the constraints or fees of centralized intermediaries. Notic3 became our way of testing the boundaries of what’s possible when you refuse to compromise the principles of transparency and autonomy.\nHow? #Notic3 was built using the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain, a challenge in itself as the language and SDK were entirely new to our team. Every feature, from subscription payments to data storage, was implemented as a smart contract, ensuring that all logic is handled on-chain.\nTo enable decentralized storage, we used Walrus, Sui’s latest data solution, which allows encrypted file blobs to be stored and retrieved directly from the chain. This ensures that creators truly own their content while maintaining privacy and immutability.\nKey technical highlights include:\nSubscription-based smart contracts that handle recurring payments and instant fund distribution. On-chain metadata management to track ownership and access rights securely. Full-stack decentralization, avoiding off-chain shortcuts even for content management and file hosting. The result is a creator platform that demonstrates both the power and difficulty of going “all in” on decentralization.\nDevpost Link #Our project has an video showcasing our work on Devpost, check it out here on Devpost\n","date":"1 October 2024","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/notice/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Notic3"},{"content":" What? #Beavs Arcade was the first project I ever worked on as part of the OSU App Development Club. My teammate and I set out to create a retro online gaming website featuring small, classic arcade-style games built from scratch using JavaScript.\nThis project was a major milestone for me — not only was it my first time using JavaScript, but it was also my very first GitHub repository. Everything from basic syntax to version control was new territory, and it marked the beginning of my journey into software development.\nWhy? #At the time, I had almost no experience in web development. I wanted to challenge myself by building something tangible and interactive rather than following a course or watching tutorials. Working on this project gave me a hands-on introduction to front-end development, game logic, and the collaborative side of programming through Git.\nWe decided on simple, nostalgic games to keep things approachable while still pushing ourselves to learn. What started as a small club project quickly became a foundational learning experience that shaped how I approach development today.\nHow? #We developed three games during the project, each one representing a new layer of learning and complexity:\nTic-Tac-Toe:\nOur first game and the one where I learned the basics of JavaScript. I built the entire logic from scratch without relying on tutorials. It was a great introduction to DOM manipulation and fundamental game structure.\nPong:\nTo better understand game loops and object-oriented programming, I followed a tutorial in another language (Processing) and translated the logic into JavaScript. This process helped me see how similar concepts can be expressed differently across languages.\nSnake:\nOur most challenging game. I didn’t use a single full tutorial for this one; instead, I studied how Snake worked conceptually and wrote the logic myself. Although we didn’t finish it during the hackathon, I kept working on it during spring break and eventually completed it.\nEven though our project placed third in the beginner category, it felt like a huge win. I came away from it with confidence, curiosity, and the satisfaction of having built something from the ground up.\nGithub Link #Feel free to check out the project on Github\n","date":"1 April 2024","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/arcade/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Beavs Arcade"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Bio #I\u0026rsquo;m Kevin Rubio—a Junior at Oregon State University studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
